Elliptic curve cryptosystems are considered an efficient
alternative to conventional systems such as DSA and RSA.
Recently, Montgomery and Edwards elliptic curves have been
used to implement cryptosystems. In particular, the elliptic
curves Curve25519 and Curve448 were used for instantiating
Diffie-Hellman protocols named X25519 and X448. Mapping
these curves to twisted Edwards curves allowed deriving two
new signature instances, called Ed25519 and Ed448, of the
Edwards Digital Signature Algorithm. In this work, we focus
on the secure and efficient software implementation of these
algorithms using SIMD parallel processing. We present
software techniques that target the Intel AVX2 vector
instruction set for accelerating prime field arithmetic and
elliptic curve operations. Our contributions result in a
high-performance software library for AVX2-ready processors.
For example, our library computes digital signatures 19%
(for Ed25519) and 29% (for Ed448) faster than previous
optimized implementations. Also, our library improves by 10%
and 20% the execution time of X25519 and X448, respectively.
