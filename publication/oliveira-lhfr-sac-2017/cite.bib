 abstract = {In the RFC7748 memorandum, the Internet Research Task Force
specified a Montgomery-ladder scalar multiplication function based
on two recently adopted elliptic curves, Curve25519 and Curve448.
The purpose of this function is to support the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange algorithm that will be included in the forthcoming version
of the Transport Layer Security cryptographic protocol. In this
paper, we describe a ladder variant that permits to accelerate the
fixed-point multiplication function inherent to the Diffie-Hellman
key pair generation phase. Our proposal combines a right-to-left
version of the Montgomery ladder along with the pre-computation of
constant values directly derived from the base-point and its
multiples. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal of a
Montgomery ladder procedure for prime elliptic curves that admits
the extensive use of pre-computation. In exchange of very modest
memory resources and a small extra programming effort, the proposed
ladder obtains significant speedups for software implementations.
Moreover, our proposal fully complies with the RFC7748 specification.
A software implementation of the X25519 and X448 functions using
our pre-computable ladder yields an acceleration factor of roughly
1.20, and 1.25 when implemented on the Haswell and the Skylake
micro-architectures, respectively.},
