 abstract = {
Cryptographic keys are increasingly stored in dedicated hardware or
behind software interfaces. Doing so limits access, such as
permitting only signing via ECDSA. This makes using them in existing
ring and group signature schemes impossible as these schemes assume
the ability to access the private key for other operations. We
present a $\Sigma$-protocol that uses a committed public key to
verify an ECDSA or Schnorr signature on a message, without revealing
the public key. We then discuss how this protocol may be used to
derive ring signatures in combination with Groth–Kohlweiss membership
proofs and other applications. This scheme has been implemented and
source code is freely available.},
