KEMTLS is a novel alternative to the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
handshake that integrates post-quantum algorithms. It uses key
encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) for both confidentiality and
authentication, achieving post-quantum security while obviating the
need for expensive post-quantum signatures. The original KEMTLS paper
presents a security analysis, Rust implementation, and benchmarks
over emulated networks. In this work, we provide full Go
implementations of KEMTLS and other post-quantum handshake
alternatives, describe their integration into a distributed system,
and provide performance evaluations over real network conditions.
We compare the standard (non-quantum-resistant) TLS 1.3 handshake
with three alternatives: one that uses post-quantum signatures in
combination with post-quantum KEMs (PQTLS), one that uses KEMTLS,
and one that is a reduced round trip version of KEMTLS (KEMTLS-PDK).
In addition to the performance evaluations, we discuss how the design
of these protocols impacts TLS from an implementation and
configuration perspective.
