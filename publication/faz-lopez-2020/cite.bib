A hash to curve function H, mapping bit strings to points
on an elliptic curve, is often required in cryptographic
schemes based on elliptic curves. Its construction is based
on a deterministic encoding and a cryptographic hash
function, which complementarily dominate its execution time.
To improve the performance of $H$, we propose a parallel
strategy where two units execute in tandem the internal
operations of $H$. We instantiate this approach with a
parallel software implementation of a hash to curve function
that outputs points on a twisted Edwards curve. A performance
benchmark on Haswell and Skylake micro-architectures shows
that our parallel implementation is 1.4 times faster than
its sequential implementation.
