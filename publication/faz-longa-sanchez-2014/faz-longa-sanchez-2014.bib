We propose efficient algorithms and formulas that improve the performance
of side-channel protected scalar multiplication exploiting the 
Gallant-Lambert-Vanstone (CRYPTO 2001) and Galbraith-Lin-Scott (EUROCRYPT
2009) methods. Firstly, by adapting Feng et al.'s recoding to the GLV 
setting, we derive new regular algorithms for variable-base scalar 
multiplication that offer protection against simple side-channel and timing 
attacks. Secondly, we propose an efficient technique that interleaves 
ARM-based and NEON-based multiprecision operations over an extension field,
as typically found on GLS curves and pairing computations, to improve
performance on modern ARM processors. Finally, we showcase the efficiency
of the proposed techniques by implementing a state-of-the-art GLV-GLS
curve in twisted Edwards form defined over $F\_p^2$, which supports
a four dimensional decomposition of the scalar and runs in constant time,
i.e., it is fully protected against timing attacks. For instance, using
a precomputed table of only 512 bytes, we compute a variable-base scalar
multiplication in 92,000 cycles on an Intel Ivy Bridge processor and in
244,000 cycles on an ARM Cortex-A15 processor. Our benchmark results and
the proposed techniques contribute to the improvement of the 
state-of-the-art performance of elliptic curve computations. Most notably,
our techniques allow us to reduce the cost of adding protection against
timing attacks in the GLV-based variable-base scalar multiplication
computation to below 10%.
