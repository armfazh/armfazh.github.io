Prio, tailored under privacy-by-design principles, is a protocol for
aggregating client-provided measurements between non-colluding
entities. The validity of measurements is determined by using a
fully linear probabilistically-checkable proof (FLPCP). The Prover
distributes secret shares of the measurement and the proof to multiple
Verifiers. These Verifiers can only use linear queries on the input
statement for validation without accessing the actual measurement.
Efficiency is key for the practical application of Prio. The FLPCP
operates with polynomials represented in the Lagrange basis using
roots of unity as the nodes. However, we observe opportunities to
improve its performance by embracing the Lagrange basis more
extensively. For instance, we show an inversion-free O(n)
time-complexity algorithm for polynomial evaluation in the Lagrange
basis (an alternative to the classic rational barycentric formula).
By applying our methods to libprio-rs, a cutting-edge Rust
implementation, the Sharding phase (proof generation) runs a 36\%
faster and the Prep-Init phase (proof verification) is twice as fast,
showing a substantial acceleration of the most time-consuming phases
of Prio.
