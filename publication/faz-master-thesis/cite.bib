 abstract = {Elliptic curve cryptography has a high significance on secure
computer applications, it provides mechanisms to ensure privacy on
data, authentication among communicating entities, as well as the
integrity of a message sent by an insecure channel.
Nowadays, there are cryptographic algorithms that ensure these
security services, however, some of them require a large amount of
computer processing. Such is the case of the scalar multiplication,
which is a fundamental operation for the implementation of elliptic
curve cryptography. It is, therefore, essential that this operation
be performed efficiently.
This thesis has focused on the analysis of algorithms and
programming techniques to reduce the computation time of the scalar
multiplication. From the algorithmic standpoint, Koblitz elliptic
curves allow that the computation of the scalar multiplication can
be quickly performed by applying the Frobenius’s endomorphism,
without using point doublings. The formulation of a parallel
algorithm allows its implementation in a multicore processor.
Extended instruction sets included in the latest computer
architectures enable parallel processing of multiple data sets.
Within these sets, the use of the carry-less multiplier enhances
the performance of operations over finite fields, thereby resulting
in acceleration of computation of scalar multiplication.
The results of this research show the speedup in the parallelization
of the scalar multiplication, optimizing both algorithmically and
with the use of recent technologies.},
