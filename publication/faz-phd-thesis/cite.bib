 abstract = {Cryptography based on elliptic curves is endowed with
efficient methods for public-key cryptography. Recent research has
shown the superiority of the Montgomery and Edwards curves over the
Weierstrass curves as they require fewer arithmetic operations.
Using these modern curves has, however, introduced several challenges
to the cryptographic algorithm’s design, opening up new opportunities
for optimization. Our main objective is to propose algorithmic
optimizations and implementation techniques for cryptographic
algorithms based on elliptic curves. In order to speed up the
execution of these algorithms, our approach relies on the use of
extensions to the instruction set architecture. In addition to those
specific for cryptography, we use extensions that follow the Single
Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) parallel computing paradigm. In
this model, the processor executes the same operation over a set of
data in parallel. We investigated how to apply SIMD to the
implementation of elliptic curve algorithms. As part of our
contributions, we design parallel algorithms for prime field and
elliptic curve arithmetic. We also design a new three-point ladder
algorithm for the scalar multiplication $P+kQ$, and a faster formula
for calculating $3P$ on Montgomery curves. These algorithms have
found applicability in isogeny-based cryptography. Using SIMD
extensions such as SSE, AVX, and AVX2, we develop optimized
implementations of the following cryptographic algorithms: X25519,
X448, SIDH, ECDH, ECDSA, EdDSA, and qDSA. Performance benchmarks
show that these implementations are faster than existing
implementations in the state of the art. Our study confirms that
using extensions to the instruction set architecture is an effective
tool for optimizing implementations of cryptographic algorithms based
on elliptic curves. May this be an incentive not only for those
seeking to speed up programs in general but also for computer
manufacturers to include more advanced extensions that support the
increasing demand for cryptography.},
