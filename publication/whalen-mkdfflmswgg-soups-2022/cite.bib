 abstract = {CAPTCHAs are necessary to protect websites from bots and
malicious crawlers, yet are increasingly solvable by automated
systems. This has led to more challenging tests that require
greater human effort and cultural knowledge; they may prevent bots
effectively but sacrifice usability and discourage the human users
they are meant to admit. We propose a new class of challenge: a
Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood (CAP) as the foundation of
a usable, pro-privacy alternative. Our challenge is constructed
using the open Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) that is supported
in most browsers. We evaluated the CAP challenge through a public
demo, with an accompanying user survey. Our evaluation indicates
that CAP has a strong likelihood of adoption by users who possess
the necessary hardware, showing good results for effectiveness and
efficiency as well as a strong expressed preference for using CAP
over traditional CAPTCHA solutions. In addition to demonstrating a
mechanism for more usable challenge tests, we identify some areas
for improvement for the WebAuthn user experience, and reflect on
the difficult usable privacy problems in this domain and how they
might be mitigated.},
