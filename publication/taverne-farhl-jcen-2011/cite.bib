 abstract = {The availability of a new carry-less multiplication
instruction in the latest Intel desktop processors significantly
accelerates multiplication in binary fields and hence presents the
opportunity for reevaluating algorithms for binary field arithmetic
and scalar multiplication over elliptic curves. We describe how to
best employ this instruction in field multiplication and the effect
on performance of doubling and halving operations. Alternate
strategies for implementing inversion and half-trace are examined
to restore most of their competitiveness relative to the new
multiplier. These improvements in field arithmetic are complemented
by a study on serial and parallel approaches for Koblitz and random
curves, where parallelization strategies are implemented and
compared. The contributions are illustrated with experimental
results improving the state-of-the-art performance of halving and
doubling-based scalar multiplication on NIST curves at the 112-
and 192-bit security levels and a new speed record for
side-channel-resistant scalar multiplication in a random curve at
the 128-bit security level. The algorithms presented in this work
were implemented on Westmere and Sandy Bridge processors, the
latest generation Intel microarchitectures.},
