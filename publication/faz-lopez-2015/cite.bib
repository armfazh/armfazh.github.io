 abstract = {
AVX2 is the newest instruction set on the Intel Haswell processor that
provides simultaneous execution of operations over vectors of 256 bits.
This work presents the advances on the applicability of AVX2 on the
development of an efficient software implementation of the elliptic
curve Diffie-Hellman protocol using the Curve25519 elliptic curve.
Also, we will discuss some advantages that vector instructions offer as
an alternative method to accelerate prime field and elliptic curve
arithmetic. The performance of our implementation shows a slight
improvement against the fastest state-of-the-art implementations.
