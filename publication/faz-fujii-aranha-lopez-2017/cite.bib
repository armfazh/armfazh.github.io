Digital signatures provide a means to publicly authenticate messages sent
over an insecure channel. Recently, the Quotient Digital Signature Algorithm
(qDSA) was introduced aiming key-compatibility with the Diffie-Hellman X25519
function. Due to the novelty of qDSA, there remains a need for an optimized
implementation that allows identifying the real impact of this new algorithm.
In this work, we focus on the secure and efficient implementation of qDSA.
By leveraging the use of precomputation on the right-to-left Joye's algorithm,
we reduced the running time of signature generation by 30-35%, and the
running time of the verification procedure by 19%. In addition, for
increased security, we show a verification method that validates qDSA
signatures unequivocally. All of these improvements were included into an
optimized software library targeting 32-bit ARM and 64-bit Intel
architectures. The improved performance achieved in these platforms, it
positions qDSA as a competitive alternative for deploying digital signatures
efficiently and securely.
