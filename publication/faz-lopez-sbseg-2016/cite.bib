 abstract = {The P-384 is one of the standardized elliptic curves by ANSI
and NIST. This curve provides a 192-bit security level and is used in
the computation of digital signatures and key-agreement protocols.
Although several publicly-available cryptographic libraries support
the P-384 curve, they have a poor performance. In this work, we
present software techniques for accelerating cryptographic operations
using the P-384 curve; first, we use the latest vector instructions
of Intel processors to implement the prime field arithmetic; second,
we devise a parallel scheduling of the complete formulas for point
addition law. As a result, on Skylake micro-architecture, our
software implementation is 15\% and 40\% faster than the OpenSSL
library for computing ECDSA signatures and the ECDH protocol,
respectively.},
