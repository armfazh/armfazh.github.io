The availability of a new carry-less multiplication instruction
in the latest Intel desktop processors significantly accelerates
multiplication in binary fields and hence presents the opportunity
for reevaluating algorithms for binary field arithmetic and scalar
multiplication over elliptic curves. We describe how to best
employ this instruction in field multiplication and the effect on
performance of doubling and halving operations. Alternate
strategies for implementing inversion and half-trace are examined
to restore most of their competitiveness relative to the new
multiplier. These improvements in field arithmetic are complemented
by a study on serial and parallel approaches for Koblitz and random
curves, where parallelization strategies are implemented and
compared. The contributions are illustrated with experimental
results improving the state-of-the-art performance of halving and
doubling-based scalar multiplication on NIST curves at the 112-
and 192-bit security levels, and a new speed record for 
side-channel resistant scalar multiplication in a random curve
at the 128-bit security level.
