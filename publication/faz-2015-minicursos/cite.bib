 abstract = {Software implementation of a cryptographic algorithm is not an
easy task even for advanced programmers, because it requires a careful
knowledge not only about algorithms but also of the target
architecture. In this tutorial, we will describe some techniques to
produce an efficient and secure software implementation. For the sake
of efficiency, we will detail how advanced vector instruction sets
accelerate the execution of the following cryptographic algorithms:
the AES encryption algorithm, the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function
and the key agreement protocol based on the elliptic curve Curve25519.
Focusing on the secure software development, we will illustrate some
implementations that are vulnerable against side-channel attacks; also
we will present some countermeasures that mitigate such attacks
thereby preventing leakage of secret information.
