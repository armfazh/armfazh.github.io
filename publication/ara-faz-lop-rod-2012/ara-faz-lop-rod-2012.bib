We design a state-of-the-art software implementation of field and 
elliptic curve arithmetic in standard Koblitz curves at the 128-bit
security level. Field arithmetic is carefully crafted by using the 
best formulae and implementation strategies available, and the 
increasingly common native support to binary field arithmetic in 
modern desktop computing platforms. The $i$-th power of the Frobenius 
automorphism on Koblitz curves is exploited to obtain new and faster 
interleaved versions of the well-known $τ$-NAF scalar multiplication 
algorithm. The usage of the $τ$^⌊m/3⌋ and $τ$^⌊m/4⌋ maps are
employed to create analogues of the 3- and 4-dimensional GLV 
decompositions and in general, the $⌊m/s⌋$-th power of the Frobenius
automorphism is applied as an analogue of an $s$-dimensional GLV
decomposition. The effectiveness of these techniques is illustrated 
by timing the scalar multiplication operation for fixed, random and
multiple points. In particular, our library is able to compute a 
random point scalar multiplication in just below 105 clock cycles, 
which sets a new speed record across all curves with or without 
endomorphisms defined over binary or prime fields. The results of our 
optimized implementation suggest a trade-off between speed, compliance
with the published standards and side-channel protection. Finally, 
we estimate the performance of curve-based cryptographic protocols
instantiated using the proposed techniques and compare our results
to related work.
