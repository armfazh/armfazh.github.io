Since its introduction by Jao and De Feo in 2011, the supersingular
isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange protocol has positioned
itself as a promising candidate for post-quantum cryptography. One
salient feature of the SIDH protocol is that it requires 
exceptionally short key sizes. However, the latency associated to
SIDH is higher than the ones reported for other post-quantum 
cryptosystem proposals. Aiming to accelerate the SIDH runtime
performance, we present in this work several algorithmic 
optimizations targeting both elliptic-curve and field arithmetic
operations. We introduce in the context of the SIDH protocol a
more efficient approach for calculating the elliptic curve
operation $P+[k]Q$. Our strategy achieves a factor 1.4 speedup 
compared with the popular variable-three-point ladder algorithm 
regularly used in the SIDH shared secret phase. Moreover, 
profiting from pre-computation techniques our algorithm yields a 
factor 1.7 acceleration for the computation of this operation in
the SIDH key generation phase. We also present an optimized 
evaluation of the point tripling formula, and discuss several 
algorithmic and implementation techniques that lead to faster
field arithmetic computations. A software implementation of the 
above improvements on an Intel Skylake Core i7-6700 processor 
gives a factor 1.33 speedup against the state-of-the-art software 
implementation of the SIDH protocol reported by 
Costello-Longa-Naehrig in CRYPTO 2016.
