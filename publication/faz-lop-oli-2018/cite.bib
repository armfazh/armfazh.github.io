The latest processors have included extensions to the instruction set
architecture tailored to speed up the execution of cryptographic
algorithms. Like the AES New Instructions (AES-NI) that target the AES
encryption algorithm, the release of the SHA New Instructions (SHA-NI),
designed to support the SHA-256 hash function, introduces a new scenario
for optimizing cryptographic software. In this work, we present a
performance evaluation of several cryptographic algorithms, hash-based
signatures and data encryption, on platforms that support AES-NI and/or
SHA-NI. In particular, we revisited several optimization techniques
targeting multiple-message hashing, and as a result, we reduce by 21%
the running time of this task by means of a pipelined SHA-NI
implementation. In public-key cryptography, multiple-message hashing
is one of the critical operations of the XMSS and XMSS^MT post-quantum
hash-based digital signatures. Using SHA-NI extensions, signatures are
computed 4x faster; however, our pipelined SHA-NI implementation
increased this speedup factor to 4.3x. For symmetric cryptography, we
revisited the implementation of AES modes of operation and reduced by
12% and 7% the running time of CBC decryption and CTR encryption,
respectively.
