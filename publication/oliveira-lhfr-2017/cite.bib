 abstract = {
In the RFC 7748 memorandum, the Internet Research Task Force specified
a Montgomery-ladder scalar multiplication function based on two recently
adopted elliptic curves, Curve25519 and Curve448. The purpose
of this function is to support the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm
that will be included in the forthcoming version of the Transport Layer
Security cryptographic protocol. In this paper, we describe a ladder
variant that permits to accelerate the fixed-point multiplication
function inherent to the Diffie-Hellman key pair generation phase.
Our proposal combines a right-to-left version of the Montgomery ladder
along with the pre-computation of constant values directly derived from
the base-point and its multiples. To our knowledge, this is the first
proposal of a Montgomery ladder procedure for prime elliptic curves
that admits the extensive use of pre-computation. In exchange of very
modest memory resources and a small extra programming effort, the
proposed ladder obtains significant speedups for software
implementations. Moreover, our proposal fully complies with the RFC
7748 specification. A software implementation of the X25519 and X448
functions using our pre-computable ladder yields an acceleration factor
of roughly 1.20, and 1.25 when implemented on the Haswell and the
Skylake micro-architectures, respectively.
